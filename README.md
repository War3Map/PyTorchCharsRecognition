# PyTorchCharsRecognition

Testing Neural Networks work with PyToch

## Requirements

- PyToch
- matploitlib


## Run

```
python test_network
```

Structure :

- models : saved neural networks models

- networks(package): neural networks classes

- results : graphs and other testing results
  - *.png* - learning results graphs
  
  - *.txt* - learning results saved as file
- other:
  - test_network(strting file): for testing networks
  - graphs_shower.py: shows learning graphs
  - graphs_loader.py: loads data for graphs from file
  - data_loader.py: loads dataset data 
  - network_testing.py: testing algorithm
  - network_training: training algorithm
  - image_prepare(future file).py: for image preparation
  - inference_test (future file).py: for inference
  - create_dataset.py(future file):  for creating datasets
