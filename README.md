# PyTorchCharsRecognition

Testing Neural Networks work with PyToch

Structure :

- CNNTest.py - CNN with MNIST dataset test
- CNN_EMNIST_test.py - CNN with EMNIST dataset test
- FFNN_MNIST_test.py - Fully Connected with MNIST dataset test
- FF_EMNIST_NN.py - Fully Connected with EMNIST dataset test

- graphs_loader.py - creates graphs from file
- graphs_shower.py - for creation graphs

- *models* - saved learning results as model
- *.png* -learning results graphs
- *.txt* - learning results saved as file
